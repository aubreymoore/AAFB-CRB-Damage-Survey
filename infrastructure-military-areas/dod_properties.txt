      Title: Federal properties
      Geospatial_Data_Presentation_Form: vector digital data
  Description:
    Abstract: This dataset shows the Department of Defense properties on Guam. It is a combination of layer initally created by the Bureau of Statistics and Plans (BSP) with additional edits and changes over the years based on data generated by the BSP funded projects and data received from Federal agencies.
    Purpose: This data set was developed as part of the Bureau of Statistics and Plans GIS database for general planning purposes.
    Supplemental_Information:
      The initial boundary input was first created around 1996 by the Bureau. In 2007, the Bureau contracted with NEXGEN to update the land parcel GIS layer for the island. Part of this project also captured the boundaries of Federal properties and those federal properties slated for return to the Government of Guam. Local law required the Government of Guam to return the land to the original land owners or their heirs. The Ancestral Lands Commission is the entity responsible for transferring Federal properties returned to the Government of Guam. 
      The Bureau also received the boundaries GIS layer from both the Navy and Dept of the Air Force around 2007. The original Bureau layer was edited to add the data from theses various sources and to remove Ancestral lands from the Federal properties layer as they were now private properties. The source data for the latter came from the Ancestral Lands Commission.

Though efforts have been made to obtain accurate data directly from the sources responsible for collecting and maintaining their boundaries, the Bureau cannot be absolutely sure that data from those various sources listed above are without errors. One would have to check these sources directly to ensure the accuracy of their data obtained.
